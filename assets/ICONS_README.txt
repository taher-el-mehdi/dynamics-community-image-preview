ICON FILES NEEDED
================

This extension requires three icon files for the browser toolbar and extension store:

1. icon16.png  (16x16 pixels)
2. icon48.png  (48x48 pixels)  
3. icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

ICON DESIGN SUGGESTIONS:
- Use a simple, recognizable image icon (e.g., a picture frame, magnifying glass over an image, or gallery icon)
- Use Microsoft Dynamics brand colors if possible (blue/teal palette)
- Keep it clean and professional
- Ensure good contrast for visibility

HOW TO CREATE ICONS:

Option 1 - Using Online Tools:
- Canva (canva.com) - Free icon creator
- Figma (figma.com) - Professional design tool
- Photopea (photopea.com) - Free Photoshop alternative

Option 2 - Using Desktop Software:
- GIMP (free, open source)
- Adobe Photoshop
- Affinity Designer

Option 3 - Use a Placeholder:
For testing purposes, you can create solid color squares with text:
1. Create a 128x128 blue square
2. Add white text "DCI" (Dynamics Community Images)
3. Save as PNG
4. Resize to create 48x48 and 16x16 versions

TEMPORARY WORKAROUND:
The extension will work without icons, but Chrome/Edge will display a default puzzle piece icon instead.
To load the extension for testing without icons, you can temporarily remove the "icons" section from manifest.json.

Once you have created your icon files, place them in this directory:
- icon16.png
- icon48.png  
- icon128.png
